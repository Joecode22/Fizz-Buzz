# FizzBuzz Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository for the FizzBuzz Project. This is a simple yet instructive project I developed as part of my learning experience with Codecademy, demonstrating basic programming concepts in C++. The FizzBuzz program is a classic test used in coding interviews and educational exercises, aimed at evaluating fundamental programming skills.

## Project Overview
The FizzBuzz Project is a small console application written in C++. It prints numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".

### Technologies Used
- C++

## Features
- Loops through numbers 1 to 100.
- Utilizes conditional statements to check divisibility.
- Prints "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" based on the number's divisibility by 3, 5, or both, respectively.
- Demonstrates basic C++ syntax and console output.

## Installation and Setup
No installation is required. To run this project, a C++ compiler is needed. The code can be compiled and run in any standard C++ environment.

## Usage
Compile the C++ file and run the executable. The program will automatically start printing the results to the console.

## Contributing
This project is a simple demonstration and is not intended for contribution. However, feel free to use it as a reference or starting point for similar projects.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was developed as part of my learning curriculum at Codecademy. I would like to express my gratitude to Codecademy for providing a structured and comprehensive learning path in programming.
- A special thanks to the online programming communities for their endless resources and support.
